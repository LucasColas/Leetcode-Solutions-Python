| Problem  | Topics Covered | solution (idea) |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| 344 - Reverse String | string, 2 pointers | [Use 2 pointers and swap the values.](https://github.com/LucasColas/Leetcode-Solutions-Python/blob/main/344%20-%20Reverse%20String.py) |
| 1721 - Swapping Nodes in a Linked List | 2 pointers | [Use 3 pointers. Find kth node from right using pointer that points to the kth node from left and use a pointer which points to the head. Iterate until tail.next == None.](https://github.com/LucasColas/Leetcode-Solutions-Python/blob/main/1721%20-%20Swapping%20Nodes%20in%20a%20Linked%20List.py) |
| 703 - Kth Largest Element in a Stream | heap, loop | [Convert list to heap, delete every largest element to get an heap of length k. Every time we add values, we delete the larget element and return the smallest element.](https://github.com/LucasColas/Leetcode-Solutions-Python/blob/main/703%20-%20Kth%20Largest%20Element%20in%20a%20Stream.py) |
| 682 - Baseball Game | array | [Iterate through ops, check different cases. Return the sum of all the scores.](https://github.com/LucasColas/Leetcode-Solutions-Python/blob/main/682%20-%20Baseball%20Game.py) | 
| 100 - Same Tree | Tree | [Check if the two values are the same or not.](https://github.com/LucasColas/Leetcode-Solutions-Python/blob/main/100%20-%20Same%20Tree.py) |
| 705 - Design HashSet | HashSet, Set | [Use set ; add, discard and search elements in the set.](https://github.com/LucasColas/Leetcode-Solutions-Python/blob/main/705%20-%20Design%20HashSet.py) |
| 706 - Design HashMap | array, index | [Use an array, the key serves as an index in the array.](https://github.com/LucasColas/Leetcode-Solutions-Python/blob/main/706%20-%20Design%20HashMap.py) | 
| 844 - Backspace String Compare | string, array, join | [Append to a list every char different from #, use join to build the new string](https://github.com/LucasColas/Leetcode-Solutions-Python/blob/main/844%20-%20Backspace%20string%20compare.py) |
